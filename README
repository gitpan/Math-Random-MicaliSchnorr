To build this module you need the GMP library installed on your computer.
See: http://gmplib.org/

You will also need either Math::GMPz or Math::GMP

Build in the usual way:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

If the GMP library is not in a location where your compiler finds it by default, 
then instead of running 'perl Makefile.PL', you'll need to run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-I/path/to/gmp_include" LIBS="-L/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"

Any problems, I am contactable by email at sisyphus at(@) cpan dot (.) org.

If building with an MSVC++ compiler against a MinGW-built gmp lib, you'll
need to additionally link to MinGW's libgcc.a and libcoldname.a. First,
create copies of the 3 '.a' files (named libgmp.lib, libgcc.lib, and
libcoldname.lib) and then run:

perl Makefile.pl INC="-IC:/path/to/gmp_include" LIBS="-LC:/path/to/gcc_lib -lgcc -LC:/path/to/coldname_lib -lcoldname -LC:/path/to/gmp_lib -lgmp"
